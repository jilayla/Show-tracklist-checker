# Tracklist Restriction Checker

## Introduction
This program is designed to assist in checking tracklists for Mixcloud shows to ensure they comply with certain restrictions. It helps identify instances where the number of tracks by an artist, consecutive tracks by an artist, or tracks from the same album exceed specified limits.

## Accessing the Program
The executable file can be found in under the dist folder. Download the respective file depending on your operating system.

### Mac Users

## How It Works
To use the program:
1. Copy the tracklist from the Admin tool's Track Info, ensuring to start from "Start" and end with the album of the last row.
2. Click the button labeled "â†µ". This button clears the "Enter tracklist here" text entry field, pastes the copied text into the field, and processes it as the new tracklist for checking.

### Features
- **Clean up tracklist**: Removes track repetitions, converts seconds into hh:mm:ss format, and realigns the columns for easier readability.
- **Reason for restriction**: Specifies the reasons for any restrictions detected in the tracklist and lists the tracks contributing to each limit exceeded.
- **Macro info**: Provides information in a format ready to be copied and pasted into a reply to the user, detailing the restrictions detected in the tracklist.
- **Copy**: Allows you to copy the resulting text from "Macro info" for quick use in replies to users.
